User Manual

The program could be configured and user can decide what to show and how to
show the chart. So first step is to know how to write the config file and
familiar with important tag's meaning.
Below is the config file format introduction.

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
------------------
File name:    config.xml
<profile>     this is the debug part information printed with WAYLAND_DEBUG env
              and the information printed using macros in profile_analyzer.h
    <file>    this tag defines the debug log file(could be multiple)
    <xxxxx>   event name's tag
              value between <xxx></xxx> is a regular expression to parse log file
              currently specify [time] and [ID](optional)

<fps>         this tag specifies which event to calculate as fps.(optional)
              you should use the one that is passed as msg to macro.

Before starting the program, please make sure the config.xml is writtend correctly.
Here are some suggestions:
1. Make sure at least one filename is assigned.
   filename can be either absolute or relative(relative root is program's directory)
2. Below <profile> tag, you can extend any type of log you want. Just a regular
   expression to tell the program how to parse it.
   For example:
        <button>                                event name tag
        \[\ *(?P&lt;time&gt;[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\]   match [124.234] so 124.234 is time
        \ *->\ *wl_touch@                       event's specified expression
        (?P&lt;id&gt;[0-9]+)                    match id
        \.button
        </button>
   that means butten event. regular expression contains time and id group.
   time is necessary. Id is optional, if has it, then events will be grouped by id.


USING PROFILING TOOL IN COMMON C/C++ PROGRAM
--------------------------------------------
First include the header file profile_analyzer.h
1. Use macro ADD_PROFILING_POINT(msg) where you want to record the time point.
msg will be the name of event's name.
2. Use macro ADD_PROFILING_START and ADD_PROFILING_END as a pair
to represent an interval of time.
Message will be printed to stderr. You can run ./exe 2>logfile and specify
logfile in config.xml.
The program will automatically add event's in the chart.


GUI
---

Run: ./gui.py
Initially the window will show a chart from all event's earliest time to latest time.
window layout is like this:
---------------------------------------------------------
-  ---------------------------------  ----------------  -
-  -                               -  -      2       -  -

Following are several features you can use:
1. Below the image box, there are two text box to input time. Events shown in chart use
   absolute time. So you can type in two time point to view all recorded events happend
   during that interval.
   View button will reset zoom information and save button can save current chart into
   a png file using two time point as filename.
2. If you have assigned the fps event, it will be shown on chart by default.
   The chart have double y-axis and share one timeline(x-axis).
   On right part, you can switch fps through checkbox.
3. Below fps checkbox are a group of event checkboxes. Checking them or not will
   show/hide corresponding events, you can get rid of unnecessary ones.
4. Below 3, tooltip is shown here.
   If you move on an exact time, it will show the time point.
   If your cursor is between two events, it will show time span.
   If your cursor is in a time interval, it will show the interval.
   Also, fps information will be shown.
5. The gantt chart image box.
   a. You can drag mouse left button on the image to zoom in your interested area.
      The image would be redrawn and more detailed information will show.
      Click mouse right button could zoom out to last image.
      You could go back anytime until whichever level.
   b. You can drag mouse in event labels' area to rearrange labels' positions.
      The label would be placed below new label under the cursor.
      After zooming in, rearranged labels would be preserved.
      After zooming out, due to more labels may be added, they would be appended at end.
